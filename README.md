# Reliza CD

Reliza CD is a tool that acts as an agent on the Kubernetes side to connect the instance to [Reliza Hub](https://relizahub.com). The deployments to the instance may be then controlled from Reliza Hub.

The recommended way to install is to use [Reliza CD Helm Chart](https://github.com/relizaio/helm-charts#3-reliza-cd-helm-chart).
